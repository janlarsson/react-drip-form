## Setup Your Project

Let's create a very simple form using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). If `create-react-app` is not installed, let's install it immediately.

```bash
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
```




## Installation

`react-drip-form` is published to npm.  
Install the stable version with the following command.

```bash
$ npm install react-drip-form --save
```




## Create Simple Forms

Copy and paste the following code into `src/App.js` and run `npm start`.

```javascript
// TODO
```

A very simple form has been completed!

We encourage you to look at [Examples](../examples/basic-form/) to use `react-drip-form` deeper!
